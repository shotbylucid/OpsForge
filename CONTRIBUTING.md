# Contributing to OpsForge

OpsForge welcomes all contributions—bug fixes, features, new modules, documentation, and suggestions.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo and create your branch**

   - Name branches by feature (e.g. `feature/add-dns-export`, `bug/fix-ad-error`).

2. **Open an issue or start a discussion**

   - If you have an idea or proposal (especially one you're not certain will be a major feature), please use the **Discussions** tab—this is the best place to talk through new ideas, improvements, and community feedback.
   - Only skip discussions if you are confident, ready to begin actual development, and prepared to make a new branch for a feature (this is most relevant for major additions from outside the owner).
   - Label issues/PRs with relevant tags (`AD`, `DNS`, `enhancement`, `bug`, etc.).

3. **Make changes and add documentation**

   - Include usage examples in the appropriate `Examples/` folder.
   - Update the relevant README for new modules or functions.

4. **Submit your Pull Request**
   - Link related issues, describe your changes, and request specific reviewers if appropriate.

## Code Style & Guidelines

- Use descriptive names for scripts and functions.
- Organize functions by purpose/action (e.g., `Get/`, `Set/`, `Test/` in `Functions/`).
- Add comments and docstrings at the start of each function.
- Reference only **fictitious IPs/domains** in samples (see [README disclaimer](README.md)).

## Community Standards

- Be respectful, helpful, and professional in all interactions.
- Avoid sharing sensitive or confidential organization details.
- Engage with other contributors—review PRs, help triage issues, suggest improvements.

## Maintainers

Subsystem maintainers review and approve changes in their areas. See [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for details.
